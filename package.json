  "description": "This is a really basic VM, that supports functions and local variables. The only supported datatype is an integer. In the file, there are 2 implementations of a factorial function; one recursive, and one iterative. There is no parser or lexer, nor is there a language to go with the VM, so any code written for it needs to be in plain bytecode.",

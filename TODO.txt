- closures
    - find the free variables of a function and move them to memory somewhere
    - this will likely require more value types than int
- there is still a sorta memory leak where things aren't removed from the stack
    - since OP_RET just sets the stack pointer to the base pointer, we don't pop
      all the stuff after the base pointer off

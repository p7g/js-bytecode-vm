TODO
----

- handle variable declarations outside of functions
    - actually, variable declaration should be handled by blocks
- implicit halt (halt should not be a part of the AST)
- there is still a sorta memory leak where things aren't removed from the stack
    - since OP_RET just sets the stack pointer to the base pointer, we don't pop
      all the stuff after the base pointer off
